Task :  design an [openai gym environment][air]  for autonomous piloting. 

-----------

	Summary

----------


Check out the full code implementation  on the Git repository [GYM-XPlane][cbir]. 


-----------

	Detailed Explanation of Approach
	
----------

This post  focuses on the  set up of Reinforcement learning environment for autonomous  flight control.  The set up  should at have 2 important characteristics: 

* realistic (close as much as possible to actual flight scenario)
* integrated communication ( between the simulation environment and the reinforcement learning algorithm)


To be continued ...

const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
